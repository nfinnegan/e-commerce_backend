## Description 📁

This backend build out uses an Express.js API to connect to a mySQL database, so we can perform CRUD operations on all of our tables (Category, Product, and Tags). Once you've cloned down the repo, use the schema.sql file to create your database. Feel free to use the seeds.sql file as well to get yourself started with dummy data ( to do so run `npm run seed`), or import your own. When you have established a connection using your credentials, simply follow the installation instructions, and then type `nodemon server.js` or `npm watch` to start listening on your dedicated localhost port. You will have the ability to create, update, delete, and find all existing database entries for all categories. Any changes you make will be saved to your database for future reference. This project is the culmination of last week's sprint where we learned sequelize and the significance of Object Relational Mapping (ORM).
